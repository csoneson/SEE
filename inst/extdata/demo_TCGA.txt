#Welcome;<p align="left">This tour illustrates salient features of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-Sequencing and clinical data for <strong>7,706</strong> tumor samples, based on count data reported by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/22/3666/240143" target="_blank">Rahman et al. (Bioinformatics, 2015)</a></p>
#Welcome;<p align="left">The data set contains measurements for <strong>23,368</strong> genes in <strong>7,706</strong> tumor samples, across <strong>20</strong> cancer types.</p><p align="left">In addition, the data set includes <strong>421</strong> clinical variables collected as sample metadata.</p>
#colDataPlot1;<p align="left">The distribution of samples across <strong>cancer type</strong> and <strong>gender</strong> can be easily vizualised using a <strong>Column data plot</strong> panel.</p><p align="left">In particular, note how breast cancer samples (<code>BRCA</code>) from female patients are already selected. This allows downstream linked panels to selectively highlight or restrict those samples when they display data.</p>
#colDataPlot1_DataBoxOpen;<p align="left">Sample metadata shown on the X and Y axes were set using the <strong>Data parameters</strong> box.</p>
#colDataPlot1_VisualBoxOpen;<p align="left">Similarly, the <strong>Visual parameters</strong> box provides control over the <strong>color</strong>, <strong>point</strong> and <strong>other</strong> aspects of the data points.</p>
#colDataPlot1_ColorBy;<p align="left">Here, we reinforce the <strong>cancer type</strong> information by color.</p>
#colDataPlot1_Downsample;<p align="left">Given the considerable number of samples, we visually <strong>downsample</strong> data points to display and update panels more rapidly.</p><p align="left"><strong>Note:</strong> Downsampling only has a <em>visual</em> effect: hidden data points are still included in selections.</p>
#colDataPlot1_LegendPosition;<p align="left">Lastly, we also moved the legend to the right of the plotting panel (the default is 'Bottom').</p>
#colDataPlot1_PanelGeneralInfo;<p align="left">Conveniently, the count and proportion of samples selected is shown whenever an active selection is detected.</p>
#colDataPlot1_PanelLinkInfo;<p align="left">Furthermore, any incoming or outgoing selection link with another panel is reported here.</p><p align="left">In this example, the panel is sending its point selection to two other panels that we will examine in a moment.</p>
#redDimPlot1;<p align="left"><strong>Reduced dimension plot</strong> panels provide a convenient view of the data in any precomputed reduced dimensions, such as <em>t</em>-SNE.</p><p align="left">Conveniently, any sample metadata or feature expression value may be overlaid as colors onto the data points.</p>
#redDimPlot1_ColorBy;<p align="left">Here, we use color to highlight again the the distribution of each <strong>cancer type</strong>.</p>
#redDimPlot1_PanelLinkInfo;<p align="left">Furthermore, we emphasise the breast cancer tumor samples selected in the <strong>Column data plot</strong> panel.</p>
#redDimPlot1_SelectEffect;<p align="left">The point selection is applied with a <strong>transparency</strong> effect, that reduces the visibility of unselected data points to <strong>10%</strong>, by default.</p>
#redDimPlot1_Downsample;<p align="left">Again, note how <strong>downsampling</strong> is applied to render the panel faster.</p>
#redDimPlot1_SampleRes;<p align="left">In this example, the plot is divided horizontally and vertically in <strong>100</strong> bins, showing no more than one data point per bin, and hiding additional data points from sight.</p>
#featExprPlot1;<p align="left">In this <strong>Feature expression plot</strong> panel, we examine the expression of <em>HER2</em> (<em>ERBB2</em>), reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer cells relative to controls by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/22/3666/240143" target="_blank">Rahman et al. (Bioinformatics, 2015)</a>.</p><p align="left">For the purpose of this tour, the other cancer types can be considered as control samples.</p>
#featExprPlot1_DataBoxOpen;<p align="left">To visualize the differential expression, we used the <strong>Data parameters</strong> box to:</p><ul><li>assign <em>ERBB2</em> to the Y-axis</li><li>show gene expression values from the assay that holds log<sub>2</sub> count per million (CPM) values</li><li>separate cancer types on the X axis</li></ul>
#featExprPlot1_Downsample;<p align="left">For this panel too, we apply <strong>downsampling</strong>.</p>
#collapse_featExprPlot1_SelectBoxOpen;<p align="left">To highlight the breast cancer tumor samples from female patients selected in the <strong>Column data plot</strong> panel, we:<ul><li>Select it the source of point selection</li><li>apply the selection with a <strong>color</strong> effect (red, by default)</li></ul>
#featExprPlot1;<p align="left">This applies the selected color to the selected samples, leaving other in their default color.</p><p align="left">The resulting effect confirms the overexpression of <em>ERBB2</em> in breast cancer cells, as reported by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/22/3666/240143" target="_blank">Rahman et al. (Bioinformatics, 2015)</a>.</p>
